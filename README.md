# NetPilot

> Intelligent remote network management platform for MikroTik, repeaters, routers, access points, and network equipment.

## Overview

NetPilot is a desktop + cloud platform designed for network technicians, MSPs, installers, cybercafés, hotels, schools, and small ISPs.

The platform allows technicians to:

* Detect network devices automatically
* Access remote networks securely
* Open Winbox / WebFig / SSH remotely
* Monitor equipment status
* Track IP changes
* Diagnose network issues
* Centralize multiple sites

Unlike general remote desktop software, NetPilot focuses specifically on network infrastructure management.

# Main Problem

Technicians often face problems such as:

* Lost router IP addresses
* Inaccessible repeater interfaces
* Devices behind NAT
* Remote troubleshooting difficulties
* Need for AnyDesk/TeamViewer sessions
* Unstable access after configuration changes
* Difficulty managing multiple sites

NetPilot solves these issues by creating a centralized remote network management system.

# MVP Goals

The first MVP focuses on:

* Remote network access
* Automatic LAN scanning
* Device discovery
* Secure tunnel connection
* Remote Winbox/Web access
* Basic monitoring dashboard

---

# Target Devices

Supported network equipment:

* MikroTik
* TP-Link
* LB-LINK
* Ubiquiti

# Golang Network Engine

NetPilot uses Golang for all low-level networking operations.

The Go engine is responsible for:

* LAN scanning
* ARP discovery
* Ping sweep
* Open ports detection
* Network diagnostics
* Tunnel communication
* Device monitoring
* Reconnection handling
* Multi-threaded network operations
* System-level networking tasks

Why Golang:

* Excellent network performance
* Lightweight binaries
* Cross-platform compilation
* High concurrency support
* Efficient socket management
* Stable desktop integration

The React + Tauri desktop application communicates with the Go networking engine locally.
